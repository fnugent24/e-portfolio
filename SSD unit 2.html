										<h2 id="content">Reflection</h2>
										<p>I have begun communicating with my teammates for the upcoming assignment. We have set up a WhatsApp group chat and we have had a zoom meeting and have organised to have weekly virtual meetings. We have agreed to use the web applications Miro and Trello to convey and update our ideas, as well as making a repository on GitHub for this project. </p>

                        <h2 id="content">Further reading:</h2>
                        <p>According to Dadzie (2005) about the natures of software patches, perhaps the most important/relevant bit was to hear that it is seemingly common for hackers to use the detailed description of the vulnerability (from which a patch is produced and is included in the patch notes) to create exploits. Thus, a balance must be made between giving the necessary information to the users and corporate administrators and not giving too much information for attacks to exploit. </p>
                        <p>After reading Sharma and Bawa (2020), it seems that that the most important/relevant point is that ‘there are no specific security activities developed especially for agile processes’ so therefore there must be a need to selectively extract ‘the most beneficial and easily integrable security activities from the well known security engineering processes’. However, there needs to be a consideration as to which security activities should be integrated into the agile process, as if the agile process integrates many of them blindly, it would become very heavy which would prevent it from remaining agile – Sharma and Bawa suggest creating a ‘compatibility matrix’ to help with this. </p>

                        <h2 id="content">Question 2: </h2>
                        <p>How can people be managed to overcome cyber security attacks from the inside? </p>
                        <p>I have selected 5 terms from ISO/IEC Standard 27000 Section 3 Terms and Definitions and suggested ways in which people can be managed to overcome cyber security attacks from the inside. </p>
                        
			<b>3.1 access control </b>
                        <p><i>means to ensure that access to assets is authorized and restricted based on business and security requirements </i></p>
                        <p>It is important for the management to implement strict access controls, ensuring that employees have the minimum level of access necessary to perform their job tasks. Likewise, to regularly review and update access permissions. It may also be necessary to avoid placing too much authority in a single person. Instead, allocating roles and responsibilities may help to prevent any one person from having unchecked control over critical systems. </p>

                        <b>3.32 information security incident management </b>
                        <p><i>set of processes for detecting, reporting, assessing, responding to, dealing with, and learning from information security incidents </i></p>
                        <p>It is crucial for the management to establish a system for employees to report suspicious activities anonymously and providing a way for them to raise concerns without fear of retribution. Furthermore, there should be clear communication about the process for reporting security incidents or suspected insider threats. It is important to make sure that employees are aware of who to contact and how to raise concerns. </p>

                        <b>3.41 management system </b>
                        <p><i>set of interrelated or interacting elements of an organization to establish policies and objectives and processes to achieve those objectives </i></p>
                        <p>It is important for the management to provide frequent cybersecurity training and awareness programs for all employees to educate them about the risks of insider threats, phishing, and other security vulnerabilities. In addition, there is a need for the management to promote a security culture, where employees understand their role in preserving cybersecurity, feel responsible for protecting sensitive information, and are encouraged to report any suspicious activity. </p>

                        <b>3.46 monitoring </b>
                        <p><i>determining the status of a system, a process or an activity </i></p>
                        <p>It is important for the management to implement systems that monitor and analyse user behaviour, looking for unusual or unauthorised activities. This can include monitoring for data exfiltration, unusual login patterns, or access to sensitive resources. Likewise, it is important to look out for anomalies in user behaviour that could indicate potential insider threats. </p>

                        <b>3.53 policy </b>
                        <p><i>intentions and direction of an organization, as formally expressed by its top management </i></p>
                        <p>It is important for the management to develop and communicate clear cybersecurity policies. This may include guidelines for data protection, outlining acceptable use of company resources and consequences for breaching security policies. It is also necessary to frequently review and implement security policies, making sure that violations are addressed quickly and consistently. </p>
