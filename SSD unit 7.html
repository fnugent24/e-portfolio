										<h2 id="content">Reflection</h2>
									<p>This week, my colleagues and I had a meeting on Microsoft Teams and discussed ideas and potential roles we would allocate ourselves to for the upcoming assignment (coding output), which will be due in unit 11. As we are more comfortable and knowledgeable about each team member’s strengths and potential weaknesses, the transition to the role allocations is now much smoother and efficient. While we had already attempted to start writing some code on the GitHub repository in the previous weeks, we are now entirely focused on this aspect, and we have also started to complete the readme file document and discussed what would be included in that. </p>

                        <h2 id="content">What is an ontology?</h2>
                        <p> <b>What do you understand about the ontology that has been presented for your reading this week? Could you attempt to define an ontology that would be relevant to the system that you are designing for the summative assessment? </b></p>
                        <p>According to Arnaut et al. (2010), an ontology, or ontologies, are defined as ‘explicit formal specifications of terms in a domain and their relationship to other terms, containing a set of concepts (entity, objects, domains, processes, goals, and results), properties, relationships, restrictions, or axioms.’ In other words, an ontology is a way to represent and organise information in a structured format (e.g. like a detailed catalogue) and to show how the concepts and categories of this specific subject area relate to one another. </p>
			<p>In terms of attempting to define an ontology relevant to the system for the summative assessment, since our system is based on an online retail system, the ontology model would define various categories and subcategories that would help to organise the information (i.e. product items) in the system in a more structured way. Furthermore, since our application is specifically catered for selling plant seeds and gardening accessories, the various categories defined might be “plant seeds” with its subcategories being “flower seeds”, “vegetable seeds” etc., and “gardening accessories” with its subcategories being “garden tools”, “garden furniture”, “garden decorations” etc. The subcategories would help to show the relationship between the various products. Additionally, the categories/subcategories would include attributes such as price range, brand, material, size. The ontology can help to manage user inventory and notify about stock levels. </p>

                        <p><b>Create a CLI/ shell that implements the following: </b></p>
			<ul>
				<li>When you enter the command LIST it lists the contents of the current directory</li>
				<li>The ADD command will add the following two numbers together and provide the result</li>
				<li>The HELP command provides a list of commands available</li>

    # Implement the 'add' command to add two numbers entered by the user
    try:

        num2 = int(input("Enter the second number: "))
        result = num1 + num2

                        <p><u>What are the two main security vulnerabilities with your shell?</u></p>
        		<p>One of the main security vulnerabilities associated with the shell is a lack of user authentication – the above code assumes that anyone who uses the shell can execute any command. This means that it is possible for hackers to use the application without any restrictions and can lead to them being able to access any sensitive data.</p>
			<p>Another major security vulnerability with the above code is that of command injection (OWASP, n.d.) – this occurs by the attacker inputting potentially harmful commands to manipulate the system which can lead to system compromise, loss of sensitive and/or important data, and disruptions of system services.</p>

			<p><u>What is one recommendation you would make to increase the security of the shell?</u></p>
			<p>According to OWASP (2021), one way to increase the security of the shell (and, more specifically, prevent command injection vulnerabilities) would be to use safe and secure APIs. Not only does it increase security, but also the reliability and efficiency of the system.</p>
