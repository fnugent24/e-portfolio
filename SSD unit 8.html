										<h2 id="content">Reflection</h2>
										<p>This week we had another group meeting regarding the ongoing assignment which requires us to produce code in response to our design document in part 1. While I thought the meeting was very productive and respectful, I somewhat still feel a bit unsure about exactly how we are going to approach the coding aspect of this assignment – I still don’t fully understand what our plan is and what we are trying to achieve. So, I will aim to clarify this confusion with my colleagues in the coming days, which will hopefully make it easier to move forward with this project. </p>
									<p>Regarding the unit content, I feel that a collaborative discussion, like we had in the early stages of the module, is a very useful way to share ideas with others and produce feedback of content. I felt that the first collaborative discussion increased my understanding of the topic of the discussion and to think about things in a different light/perspective, which I hope this discussion will also do.</p>

					<p><b>Answer the following questions in your e-portfolio:</b></p>	
<li> Why did you select the algorithm you chose? </li>
	<p>I chose the reverse cipher technique where each character in the plaintext is reversed/swapped with its corresponding character from the end of the alphabet or character set.</p>
	<li> Would it meet the GDPR regulations? Justify your answer.</li>
	<p>No, this technique would not meet the GDPR regulations. This is because the reverse cipher technique is very weak whereby a hacker can easily decrypt the cipher to get to the original message – all they have to do is use the same algorithm and put the encrypted text in the message variable:</p>

	<li> The (anonymous) TrueCrypt authors have said “Using TrueCrypt is not secure as it may contain unfixed security issues” (TrueCrypt, 2014). Does the cryptanalysis provided above prove or disprove this assumption?</li>
	<li> Would you be prepared to recommend TrueCrypt to a friend as a secure storage environment? What caveats (if any) would you add?</li>
	<li> Present an ontology design which captures the weaknesses of TrueCrypt, and organise them according to their severity. Expand the ontology design by considering the factors which will cause each weakness to become an issue from a user's perspective. For example, if a user wishes to encrypt a disk storing bank details using TrueCrypt, which weakness of the software might cause this specific user goal to be negatively impacted? </li>

	<p>The cryptanalysis report provided by Junestam and Guigo (2014) does support the assumption by the authors of TrueCrypt that “[u]sing TrueCrypt is not secure as it may contain unfixed security issues” (TrueCrypt, 2014). The findings of the report reveal four cryptography vulnerabilities in TrueCrypt, indicating that TrueCrypt lacks a fundamental sense of security. Furthermore, the report highlights these issues as potentially leading to unpredictable results, whereby it is stated that “CryptAcquireContext may silently fail in unusual scenarios” as well as “AES implementation [being] susceptible to cache-timing attacks” (Junestam and Guigo, 2014; p, 12), where both of these are marked as high in severity levels. Thus, the findings support the assumption by the authors of TrueCrypt that the application “may contain unfixed security issues”. On the other hand, as noted by cryptography specialist Matt Green, who commented on the report, “[t]he NCC audit found no evidence of deliberate backdoors, or any severe design flaws that will make the software insecure in most instances.” (Green, 2015). This is also important to bear in mind as the findings did not explicitly declare TrueCrypt as being insecure piece of software. However, the undoubtable thing is that TrueCrypt is no longer maintained and has not been since 2014. This means that if a security vulnerability is found, there will not be anybody to report it to, which means that it will not ever be fixed. Thus, while it may be deemed as a secure system now, there is an ever-growing risk that it may become insecure sometime in the future.</p>
	<p>In relation to the question of whether I would recommend TrueCrypt as a secure storage environment, I would again point to what I wrote above about the lack of maintainability of TrueCrypt by the developers, which would inevitably lead it to becoming more at risk of security vulnerabilities over time. Furthermore, as the nature of TrueCrypt is that it is inherently linked to the encryption of data from storage devices, I would be hesitant to ultimately be prepared recommend it to others.</p>
