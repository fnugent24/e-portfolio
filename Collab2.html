									<b><li>The (anonymous) TrueCrypt authors have said “Using TrueCrypt is not secure as it may contain unfixed security issues” (TrueCrypt, 2014). Does the cryptanalysis provided above prove or disprove this assumption?</b></li>
									<b><li>Would you be prepared to recommend TrueCrypt to a friend as a secure storage environment? What caveats (if any) would you add?</b></li>
									<b><li>Present an ontology design which captures the weaknesses of TrueCrypt, and organise them according to their severity. Expand the ontology design by considering the factors which will cause each weakness to become an issue from a user's perspective. For example, if a user wishes to encrypt a disk storing bank details using TrueCrypt, which weakness of the software might cause this specific user goal to be negatively impacted?</b></li>

										<p>The cryptanalysis report provided by Junestam and Guigo (2014) does support the assumption by the authors of TrueCrypt that “[u]sing TrueCrypt is not secure as it may contain unfixed security issues” (TrueCrypt, 2014). The findings of the report reveal four cryptography vulnerabilities in TrueCrypt, indicating that TrueCrypt lacks a fundamental sense of security. Furthermore, the report highlights these issues as potentially leading to unpredictable results, whereby it is stated that “CryptAcquireContext may silently fail in unusual scenarios” as well as “AES implementation [being] susceptible to cache-timing attacks” (Junestam and Guigo, 2014; p, 12), where both of these are marked as high in severity levels. Thus, the findings support the assumption by the authors of TrueCrypt that the application “may contain unfixed security issues”. On the other hand, as noted by cryptography specialist Matt Green, who commented on the report, “[t]he NCC audit found no evidence of deliberate backdoors, or any severe design flaws that will make the software insecure in most instances.” (Green, 2015). This is also important to bear in mind as the findings did not explicitly declare TrueCrypt as being insecure piece of software. However, the undoubtable thing is that TrueCrypt is no longer maintained and has not been since 2014. This means that if a security vulnerability is found, there will not be anybody to report it to, which means that it will not ever be fixed. Thus, while it may be deemed as a secure system now, there is an ever-growing risk that it may become insecure sometime in the future.</p>
										<p>In relation to the question of whether I would recommend TrueCrypt as a secure storage environment, I would again point to what I wrote above about the lack of maintainability of TrueCrypt by the developers, which would inevitably lead it to becoming more at risk of security vulnerabilities over time. Furthermore, as the nature of TrueCrypt is that it is inherently linked to the encryption of data from storage devices, I would be hesitant to ultimately be prepared recommend it to others.</p>

									<p>Hi Liam,
I agree on the whole with your argument that the cryptanalysis report provided by Junestam and Guigo (2014) supports the assumption that “[u]sing TrueCrypt is not secure as it may contain unfixed security issues” (TrueCrypt, 2014). A few points which I'm sure you were aware of but that I thought would still be helpful to include in this discussion are: 
</p>
									<p><li>That TrueCrypt has not been maintained/updated by the developers since 2014. This means that if a security vulnerability is found, there will not be anybody to report it to, and thus the issue(s) will not be able to be fixed.</li></p>
									<p><li>It's important to note that while we can assume from the cryptoanalysis report that using TrueCrypt is potentially unsafe, the report does not explicitly state that the errors found make TrueCrypt a fundamentally insecure piece of software. This is supported by cryptography specialist Matt Green, who comments that “[t]he NCC audit found no evidence of deliberate backdoors, or any severe design flaws that will make the software insecure in most instances.” (Green, 2015).</li></p>
									<p>In addition to your point about not being prepared to recommend TrueCrypt to a friend, it might perhaps as well be useful to suggest some alternative applications to use rather than TrueCrypt. From this, it might be worth going into more detail about the possible applications out there and what benefits they would bring to the user. An option could be to suggest the use of VeraCrypt, which is the direct successor of TrueCrypt and which fixed many of the security issues associated with TrueCrypt, and continues to be maintained by the developers (VeraCrypt, n.d.)</p>

									<p>Hi Sebastien,
I agree with your view that while we can assume from the cryptoanalysis report by Junestam & Guigo (2014) that using TrueCrypt is potentially unsafe, the report does not explicitly state that the errors found make TrueCrypt a fundamentally insecure piece of software. I would also note that this is supported by cryptography specialist Matt Green, who comments that “[t]he NCC audit found no evidence of deliberate backdoors, or any severe design flaws that will make the software insecure in most instances.” (Green, 2015).
It is good that you highlighted to use an alternative and “more current and updated application instead”. But perhaps it might be worth going into more detail about the possible applications out there and what benefits they would bring to the user. An option could be to suggest the use of VeraCrypt, which is the direct successor of TrueCrypt and which fixed many of the security issues associated with TrueCrypt, and continues to be maintained by the developers (VeraCrypt, n.d.)

									<p><b>Provide a summary of the discussion based on your initial post and the feedback from your peers. This is your 'Summary' post. Agree or otherwise, with reasons, with the contributions and reviews made by other students on the topic under discussion, enhancing your original post. This should be 300 words (excluding references).</b></p>
									<p><b><u>Summary Post:</u></b></p>
									<p>Upon receiving feedback from my peers and reflecting on my initial post, I have created a summary post which builds upon my initial comments, and I believe enhances my original post.</p>
									<p>Firstly, while I appreciate the views of peers that the report makes a damning indication of the issues with TrueCrypt, I still maintain my initial view that the cryptanalysis report does not explicitly state that TrueCrypt is/was an insecure application. It is important to bear that in mind when thinking about the discussion question as a whole (does the cryptanalysis prove or disprove the assumption that TrueCrypt is not secure?) - it seems a more nuanced answer than a simple black/while “yes, it is insecure” or “no it is not insecure”. Although, I do find the comment by a peer interesting where they believe that ‘when a system becomes no longer maintained then its security is no longer valid’.</p>
									<p>One aspect that I would add more on after reflecting upon my initial answer is that in relation to my point about not being prepared to recommend TrueCrypt to a friend, I believe as well it would perhaps be useful to suggest some alternative applications to use rather than TrueCrypt. From this, it might be worth going into more detail about the possible applications out there and what benefits they would bring to the user. An option could be to suggest the use of VeraCrypt, which is the direct successor of TrueCrypt and which fixed many of the security issues associated with TrueCrypt, and continues to be maintained by the developers (VeraCrypt, n.d.)</p>
