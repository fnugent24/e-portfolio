                        <h2 id="content">Portfolio component – Exploring the Cyclomatic Complexity’s Relevance Today:</h2>
			<p>The Cyclomatic Complexity is commonly considered in modules on testing the validity of code design today. However, in your opinion, should it be? Does it remain relevant today? Specific to the focus of this module, is it relevant in our quest to develop secure software? Justify all opinions which support your argument and share your responses with your team. </p>
			<p>Cyclomatic complexity (also called the McCabe complexity or the McCabe index) is referred to as a measurement used to indicate the complexity of a computer program (i.e. the number of linear independent paths within the program’s source code from start to finish.) (Pillai, 2017; Wijendra and Hewagamage, 2021). Essentially, the higher the complexity value, the harder it is to understand it, which leads to a greater amount of test cases to modify the particular code (Wijendra and Hewagamage, 2021). </p>
			      <p>While Cyclomatic complexity seems to be a controversial metric, its wide use in the industry and it’s (still) current stance of being one of the most popular and significant measurements for code analysis clearly suggest that it must have some apparent value and relevance, even today. Some of the benefits of cyclomatic complexity are that it can help to predict which components of code might need more thorough testing and debugging due to it indicating that the higher complexity of code, the more likely it is to contain bugs. It is also relatively ‘simple to calculate and intuitive to understand’ and thus can be taught fairly rapidly (Ebert et al., 2016). In terms of cyclomatic complexity’s role and value in software security, Ebert and colleagues state that ‘Static control-flow-analysis tools incorporating Cyclomatic Complexity can also find security vulnerabilities such as dead code, often used as back doors for hijacking software’ (Ebert et al., 2016). </p>
			      <p>However, there are some aspects to consider to perhaps argue against its value and relevance. For example, while low complexity of code is thought to be a good indicator of the code’s quality, it may promote writing code that is in turn overly simplistic, which may not be sufficient for the application needs. An additional weakness is argued to be that while cyclomatic complexity provides a strong use for measuring testability, this is not necessarily the same as being a good indicator for maintainability (Sonar, 2016). For example, while reducing the number of branches or decision points in code can help to improve readability, this may address issues related to the organisation of code or the overall design quality. A further issue related to the use of cyclomatic complexity is that it has the tendency to be misused as a performance metric, where developers may believe that reducing cyclomatic complexity will avoid them to consider addressing the underlying issues that contribute to it (BlueOptima, 2023). Indeed, Cervin and Trenter (2022) could not find any correlation between the two metrics in their research. </p>
