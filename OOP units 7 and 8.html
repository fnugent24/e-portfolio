									<p>I feel that there are still certain data structures which I need to go back to and make sure I’m comfortable with – we focused on data structures quite a bit in the previous module and I remember going through some of them and not being entirely comfortable with (such as tuples, sets and sequences). It’s important to focus on these (and data structures in general) in the coming few weeks as that will be a part to include in the upcoming assignment of the driverless car.</p>
									<p>Return values are a useful tool in terms of debugging/seeing where the error comes from.</p>
									<p>A Python return statement can only return an object, not a value. It can only return one object (which can contain multiple values).</p>
									<p><b><u>Further reading:</u></b></p>
									<p>The chapter “Python Data Structures” by Phillips (2018) has been useful in providing a recap of some of the core data structures in Python – including:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Tuples - the fact that they are immutable, can use them as keys in dictionaries, and can store data in them in order;</li>
										<li>And sets - that they have a very similar syntactic structure to dictionaries (instead of using colons to separate the pairs of values, they use commas to separate them), and that they are most useful when using at least two of them in combination with each other.</li>
									</ul>
									<p>The article by Kuk et al. (2019) is an interesting read showing the importance of Python language in the field of cybersecurity – suggests that knowledge of Python can be a particularly useful advantage compared to other programming languages in cybersecurity as it emphasises usage of algorithm designs/data structures. The article has also led to me being (more) interested in the field of cybersecurity – potentially an area to research regarding what opportunities there are in this sector?</p>

										<li>Discuss the ways in which data structures support object-oriented development. Use examples of three different data structures to contextualise your response.</li>
									</ol>
									<p>Object-oriented development is a programming paradigm that emphasises the use of objects, which encapsulate data and behaviour, to model real-world entities. Data structures help facilitate the management of these objects and their interactions.</p>
									<p>One example of a data structure is a list. Lists play a vital role by providing a convenient way to manage (encapsulate) and organise/manipulate collections of objects. They allow multiple objects to be stored sequentially, which makes it easier for developers to perform group operations efficiently and enhance the overall flexibility and maintainability of the application.</p>
									<p>Another example of data structure supporting OOP is a set. Sets play a significant role by providing a specialised data structure for managing collections of unique objects. Unlike lists, sets do not allow duplicate items, which makes them particularly useful to developers when needing to maintain a unique collection of objects. However, sets also have some disadvantages compared to lists such as being unordered and only containing immutable values.</p>
									<p>A third data structure is a dictionary. Dictionaries provide a way for mapping keys to values. They are often used to represent attributes and properties of objects in an OOP setting and provide a flexible and efficient of doing this. By implementing dictionaries, developers can create more flexible and adaptable object-oriented systems.</p>
