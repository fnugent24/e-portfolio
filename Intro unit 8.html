                  <p>An algorithm is a sequence set of instructions, executable steps that defines a terminating process in order to generate a meaningful output.</p>
                  <p>We often use the terms ‘program’ and ‘algorithm’ interchangeably, but there is a clear distinction between a program and an algorithm. Rather, a program is a formal representation of an algorithm that needs to be executed by a computer. So, a program follows a set of distinct processes that needs to be executed in order to implement an algorithm.</p>
                  <p>Pseudocode is useful to:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Describe an algorithm using natural language</li>
                    <li>Write an algorithm without following strict syntax rules</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>There is no gap (space) between 2 words when defining a variable!</p>
                  <p>An if statement does not do anything if the Boolean expression is false. It only tests to see if a condition is true. A false expression skips the indented code.</p>
                  <p>The else statement is used to introduce the code to run when the Boolean expression is false.</p>
                  <p>A for loop is a very useful iteration control structure and often used in algorithm implementation to test elements in a list. A for loop is used to iterate over a list. Iterating over a list allows you to deal with all the elements in a list individually. Iterating over the list means to start with the element at index 0, and then progress until you reach the end of the list.</p>
                  <p>Complexity analysis determines the timing of execution in three different scenarios. A graph chart can be used to determine the execution time against the length of a data list. As an example, if we aim to insert a number and somehow this insertion takes place at the beginning of an ordered number list, then this is a best-case scenario. However, if this insertion takes place towards the end of the data list, then the execution time of this algorithm will be quite high, and we can then say that this is an analysis which will represent the worst-case.</p>
                  <p>Algorithms are implemented by high-level languages. The programs that are written in any of the high-level languages are called ‘source code’.</p>
                  <p>In object-oriented programming techniques, the two fundamental concepts are class and objects. A class is an abstract representation for data and its behaviour, often called methods. On the other hand, object is an instance of a class and represents real world objects.</p>
                  <p>Inheritance is a very important feature of object-oriented programming and it has made object-oriented programming very popular. Inheritance enhances usability of the code by defining a `superclass’, in other words, an abstract class, and then producing more specialised classes by inheriting the features from the superclass.</p>
