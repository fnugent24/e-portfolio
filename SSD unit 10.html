									<p><b>Read Schmitz et al (2016) article about faceted data.</b></p>
									<p><b><li>Do you think this is a good approach to protect systems from data leakage? What are the pros and cons?</li></b></p>
									<p>Faceted Dynamic Information Flow (FDIF) is a security model that enforces information flow policies by tracking and controlling the flow of information within a computer system. It works by associating facets (i.e. “labels” or “categories”) with data in order to group that respective data. </p>
									<p>Building on Austin and Flanagan’s research about the notion of “faceted values” - which are described as ‘a new mechanism for providing information flow security in a dynamic manner that overcomes [security] limitations’ (Austin and Flanagan, 2012, p. 165) - Schmitz et al. (2016) also advocate the FDIF approach. They suggest that FDIF is a good approach to protect systems from data leakage as it ensures that sensitive data is only accessible to certain users with the appropriate permissions. This systematic nature of the FDIF model helps organisations maintain the confidentiality and integrity of data. Schmitz and colleagues also advocate the technique of “faceted evaluation”, which uses ‘special faceted values that contain both a public view and private view of the data’. This technique, they argue, helps to achieve a better performance that secure multi-execution provides. More recent research has also suggested that FDID is a good approach to protect systems from data leakage. Chen et al. (2021) argue that this approach is effective at ‘prevent[ing] control data attacks and non-control data attacks at runtime; and analy[sing] program performance’ (Chen et al., 2021, p. 1).</p>
									<p>However, the successfulness of the approach depends on its implementation by developers and what type of system it is being implemented for. One issue that can arise related to its complexity, whereby implementing and maintaining it requires a high understanding of the system’s security requirements from the developers. Furthermore, there may be usability issues involved, whereby its focus on high detailed access control can lead to further challenges in users’ ability to access the system, such as the access control becoming too restrictive which can limit the efficiency of performing tasks or being able to access the necessary information. Overall, therefore, there should be careful consideration of these aspects before fulling implementing it for the system.</p>
