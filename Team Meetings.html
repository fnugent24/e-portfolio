										<h1>Team Meetings</h1>

									<!-- Content -->
										<h2 id="content">The team were expected to have regular meetings throughout the course of the module. This was an opportunity for us to meet, discuss and agree upon aspects of the ongoing assignment process.</h2>
									<p><u>Initial Team Meeting – 14/8/23</u></p>
									<p>The team held a zoom meeting to discuss the contract and ideas for the upcoming assignment. We set up a WhatsApp group chat and organised to have weekly virtual meetings. We agreed to use the web applications Miro and Trello to convey and update our ideas, as well as making a repository on GitHub for this project.</p>
									<p><u>Team Meeting 23/8/23</u></p>
									<p>The team caught up about the assignment via Microsoft Teams and discussed what we had accomplished so far and what areas we could focus on for the following week(s). We had got a first template up and were constantly adding content to the document. Furthermore, we began to address the coding aspects of the assignment and started to write some code on the GitHub repository, which had been constantly updated.</p>
									<p><u>Team Meeting 31/8/23</u></p>
									<p>The team discussed the progress made for the summative assignment as well as agreeing upon submitting a draft of the design document to the lecturer for added clarification and guidance. We reviewed the actions on the collaborative tools (Trello and Miro) and discussed further about our tasks going forward.</p>
									<p><u>Team Meeting 1/9/23</u></p>
									<p>The team discussed the feedback given by the lecturer on their review of the design document. We thought about how we could improve and refine the document based on the comments that the lecturer provided. We reviewed the ongoing completion of activities for that week.</p>
									<p><u>Team Meeting 7/9/23</u></p>
									<p>The team reviewed the design document that was now in its final stages before submission and we agreed on a finishing date. Work was done on refining the documents (including making sure that the document was looking organised and professional, adjusting any spelling mistakes, making sure that the references were correctly presented).</p>
									<p><u>Team Meeting 13/9/23</u></p>
									<p>The team checked that the design document was finalised and ready for submission. We agreed upon who was to submit the assignment on everyone’s behalf. We also checked about needing to submit our own individualised peer review documents on top of the main design document.</p>
									<p><u>Team Meeting 21/9/23</u></p>
									<p>The team met to discuss ideas and the allocation of roles for the second assignment (coding output), due in unit 11. While we had already started on writing the code on the GitHub repository in the previous weeks, we were now entirely focused on this aspect.</p>
									<p><u>Team Meeting 29/9/23</u></p>
									<p>The team met to review our ongoing process with the assignment. Furthermore, roles were allocated for each team member whereby I agreed upon implementing the linting and testing aspects of the application while also overseeing the development of the main document (that was to be submitted later on) and its accompanying README file. The other two members were more focussed on building and maintaining the application requirements.</p>
									<p><u>Team Meeting 3/10/23</u></p>
									<p>The team met to review our ongoing process with the assignment. Each member was given some time to showcase their progress since the last meeting as well as the other members giving them feedback and asking them questions about certain aspects if they did not fully understand themselves. The team also organised a time to have a pre-demonstration of the application with the lecturer in the hopes that it would provide some useful feedback and potential aspects to build/improve upon.</p>
									<p><u>Team Meeting 17/10/23</u></p>
									<p>The team discussed the feedback given by the lecturer and agreed on implementing additional features that we believed would improve the application’s security levels, which was a crucial point of feedback to focus on from the lecturer.</p>
									<p><u>Team Meeting 20/10/23</u></p>
									<p>The team reviewed and finalised the application and accompanying document (with the README file). We discussed how we should structure the upcoming presentation by showcasing the application. As our roles were allocated to specific tasks on the assignment (whereby I was tasked with developing the document and README file), we thought that we should each provide a segment of presenting on our focussed areas for this project (where the other two members focussed on talking about the CLI and CRUD functionality and the API functionality respectively).</p>
