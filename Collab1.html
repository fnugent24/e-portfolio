                      <h2 id="content">Broken Access Control</h2>
                        <p>I used an activity diagram to illustrate the steps that may lead to the Broken Access Control weakness (OWASP, 2023) as they help to visualise the sequence of steps involved within a process in a more explicit manner - in this case, how the different actions, activities and decisions lead up to the vulnerability occurrence. An activity diagram is useful to show the dynamic nature of a system (“how” something happens) rather than “what” it does. Other diagrams such as Sequence diagrams and State Machine diagrams are also appropriate due to their representation of dynamic behaviour between the different objects (or states). </p>
                        <p>While a use case diagram may be useful to display the interactions between various actors and the system, and a class diagram might be helpful to represent the overall structure of classes and their relationship in a system, both lack the effectiveness of showing the dynamic sequence of events that lead up to a security vulnerability like Broken Access Control. </p>

<p><b><u>Summary Post</u></b></p>
<p> Upon receiving feedback from my peers and reflecting on my initial post, as well as gaining knowledge from the following unit(s), I have created a summary post which provides some additional information which I believe improves upon my original ideas. </p>
<p>First, I agree on the feedback that my UML design lacks sufficient context and details as to what it is trying to convey. There has been some confusion as to what is going on in my diagram, namely what role (i.e. a user or hacker) that is trying to access the authentication check. Therefore, I have decided that one way in which this can be improved upon is by creating two separate processes in the diagram – one which clearly expresses the process from the hacker’s view (how they get into the system and get past the authentication check), and the other which expresses the process of the user. This therefore gives the viewer of the diagram a much clearer understanding of which process they are looking at. Perhaps one lesson that I have taken on board for this is that while the UML diagram may make sense for me (which it should, as it has been created solely from my ideas), a good way to ensure it makes sense to another person viewing the diagram is to put myself in their shoes (i.e. without any previous context) and then to see if there still needs to be more detail added.</p>
<p>Additionally, the previous module tutor whom we had (and focussed quite a bit on UML diagrams with), seemed to emphasise the use of making the diagrams as simple as possible and to ideally prevent from over-complicating them. But perhaps, I went too extreme on his advice and led instead to create a diagram that was too simplistic in design, which as a result, made it ineffective to extract valuable information from. </p>
<p>An additional aspect of feedback which I find interesting is that I originally felt that a use case diagram and class diagram would be insufficient to use for this particular security vulnerability - Broken Access Control (OWASP, 2023). While I felt that an activity diagram would best represent the process leading up to the vulnerability occurrence (which I still maintain), it is interesting to read views from peers on how a (mis)use case diagram can still be used in this scenario and be a valuable means of helping to providing context and identify potential areas where Broken Access Control vulnerabilities might occur. While the (mis)use case diagram won’t provide a detailed illustration of the steps leading up to the vulnerability, it can still be used as a starting point to identify which aspects of the system may be vulnerable to Broken Access Control. Indeed, as noted by Sindre (2007), misuse case diagrams can ‘encourage developers to think from the perspective of the attacker, thus promoting creativity in identifying threats and potential vulnerabilities’ (Sindre, 2007, p. 356). Additionally, they can help to promote communication both between developers and among customers. Thus, there is still some use to implementing a use case diagram design, which I had perhaps initially overlooked. </p>

			<p><b><u>Peer Response 1:</u></b></p>
                        <p> Your implementation of a use case diagram to represent Broken Access Control (OWASP, 2023) is very interesting, Liam.</p>

<p>I would initially feel that an activity diagram would best represent the process leading up to the vulnerability occurrence as an activity diagram illustrates the dynamic nature of a system (i.e. showing the build up of the vulnerability over time).</p>

<p>However, I case diagram can still be used in this scenario and be a valuable means of helping to providing context and identify potential areas where Broken Access Control vulnerabilities might occur. While the use case diagram won’t provide a detailed illustration of the steps leading up to the vulnerability, it can still be used as a starting point to identify which aspects of the system may be vulnerable to Broken Access Control. Indeed, as noted by Sindre (2007), misuse case diagrams can ‘encourage developers to think from the perspective of the attacker, thus promoting creativity in identifying threats and potential vulnerabilities’ (Sindre, 2007, p. 356).</p>

<p>In terms of the diagram itself, you have made it clear about the steps building up to the vulnerability occuring. I also like that you have made the attacker and user distinct actors so it is clear to see where the attacker's role comes into the situation, and have made the attacker's actions in red so that it is easy to distinguish between what they and the legitimate user do.</p>

                        <p> Hi Adesola, I thought it would be useful for you to provide some points of feedback which you could perhaps take on board. Hopefully these points will be helpful. </p>

<p>Firstly, it's great that you have added some context regarding what cryptographic failures are and how they could arise. As my other colleagues have said, this information provides a useful understanding straight away of what you are wanting us to see. </p>

<p>Also, regarding the diagram itself, while it is good that you have provided two flow charts; one depicting the build up to the cryptographic failure security vulnerability and the other showing how this security failure can be successfully prevented, I think it would be even better if you clearly expressed that one of them was showing the process from the hacker's point of view (i.e. mention at the start point of the diagram that this is the hacker's point of view) and the other which distinctly expresses the process where the vulnerability has been successfully prevented (perhaps from a legitimate user's point of view). This therefore gives the viewer of the diagram a much clearer understanding of which process they are looking at.</p>

<p>I also think it would be valuable as well to include potential other UML diagrams you could include as an alternate way of showing this security vulnerability. For example, while I think you are right that an activity diagram is perhaps the most suitable choice of diagram to use for this situation, something like a use case diagram could also be used to help provide context and identify potential areas where cryptographic failure vulnerabilities might occur. While the use case diagram won’t provide a detailed illustration of the steps leading up to the vulnerability, it can still be used as a starting point to identify which aspects of the system may be vulnerable to crytographic failure. As Sindre (2007) notes, misuse case diagrams can ‘encourage developers to think from the perspective of the attacker, thus promoting creativity in identifying threats and potential vulnerabilities’ (Sindre, 2007, p. 356).</p>
